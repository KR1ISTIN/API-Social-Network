# API-Social-Network
An API built using MongoDB and Mongoose

## Description
API Social Network was created to gain knowledge and understanding how MongoDB and Mongoose works to create a backend API with using a NoSql database. I learned how create controllers and models with MongoDB instead of MYSql syntax. This project allows you to create a user, a thought associated with that user and a reaction by another user. You are also able to update and delete a user and thoughts connected to the user. I look forward to gaining further knowledge in using a NoSql database in my future projects.
